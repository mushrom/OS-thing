Obsidian os {#mainpage}
===========
This is a small OS project, at the moment consisting of barebones kernel. It is a monolithic kernel atm, supporting basic multitasking, basic ipc, a vfs, initrd filesystem, usermode, and flat binaries.

To build:
---------
You'll need:

- A unix-like environment, such as Linux or FreeBSD
- Basic tools such as a C compiler, nasm, GNU make, etc
- The [vdrive](https://github.com/downloads/dragontux/OS-thing/vdrive.hdd.gz) image

build process:

     make cross-cc 	#if you don't already have a cross compiler set up
     make
     make docs 		#if you want documentation generated by doxygen
     make test		#To start qemu
