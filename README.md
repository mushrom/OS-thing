This is a small OS project, at the moment consisting of barebones kernel. It's intended to be yet another posix clone, for educational purposes. 

To build it, you'll need a C compiler, nasm, and a unix-like environment (for image generation.)
In the root directory, just `make` it. You'll probably need to change some flags in the kernel's Makefile.
