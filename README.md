This is a small OS project, at the moment consisting of an extremely barebones kernel that prints strings like nothing else. :P

Atm you can boot it by using `qemu -kernel kernel.bin`
or by setting up the bootloader yourself.

Some of this code is from wiki.osdev.org, namely loader.s and linker.ld. I'll replace them when I'm not a noob, heh
